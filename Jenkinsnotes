FOr build: Maven, Ant and Gradle
Maven and Jenkins notes:
------------------------
> Maven is a build tool used to create packages
> Maven works on well defined directory structure
> Maven has a configuration : POM.xml (Project Object Model)
> Plugins are defined in POM.xml file in GAV format.
> G=> group id, A==> Artifact id, V==> Application version.
> group id: Name of company
> Artifact id: name of project
> Version
> Maven life cycle:
	gather requrement
	compilation : compile
	testing : test
	install : install
	package : package
	deploy : deploy
> Maven non-default lifecycle
	Site: Used to create documentation
	clean: To clean all runtime files when its not needed anymore.


> Any requirement provided to maven is accepet as a goal by Maven and Maven uses certain plugins to execute those goals.
> plugin : It is a third part software needed to execute goal 

>mvn --version
> apt install maven ==> ubuntu, debian
> yum install maven ==> rhel, centos
> tree ==> Used to display structure of a directory.
> mvn archtype:generate
> mvn compile ==> compile our code
> mvn test ==> provided test results
> mvn package ==> create .jar file
> mvn clean ==> cleaned target directory
> mvn site ==> create all help files.




Jenkins:

web based CICD tool developed by hudson:
CICD: Continuous integration and continuous deployment.

> scenerio 3:
> Create jenkins job
	Freestyle jobs: User inteface based job
	Pipeline job: Coded
> Jenkins plugin
manage Jenkins > plugins > 1.updates(updates on installed plugin) 
2.available plugins(plugins which is available in jenkins for installation) 
3.Installed plugins(plugins which are already installed) 
4.Adavanced(allows you to write code to create a plugin)

> Jenkins security > manage jenkins > security
1. Authentication: who can login
sso: single sign on works on AD(active directory), LDAP protocols
2. Authorization: what a logged in user can do
> Matrix  based : restrict priviles to user on Jenkins level as well as on job/project/build level.
> project based matrix: restrict priviles to user on Jenkins level as well as on job/project/build level, but grant elevated priveleges on a specific job/project/build.

> Integrate scm/vcs (github) with Jenkins > choose option git and provide repo url and select right branch.
> AUtomated trigger of pipeline
> Poll scm :  the syntax of cron: define the schedule using below format
: https://crontab.guru/
MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW
MINUTE	Minutes within the hour (0–59)
HOUR	The hour of the day (0–23)
DOM	The day of the month (1–31)
MONTH	The month (1–12)
DOW	The day of the week (0–7) where 0 and 7 are Sunday
